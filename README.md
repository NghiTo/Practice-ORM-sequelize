# Project Setup Guide

## Introduction

This project is designed to help you quickly get up and running. Follow the steps below to configure your environment and start the project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)
- MySQL

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repository/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Install the required npm packages by running:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Environment Variables:**

   The project uses a `.env` file to manage environment-specific configurations. You need to create or update this file with the appropriate settings.

   **Steps:**

   - If an example file exists, rename `.env.example` to `.env`:

     ```bash
     mv .env.example .env
     ```

   - Open the `.env` file in a text editor:

     ```bash
     nano .env
     ```

   - Update the following variables in the `.env` file as needed:

     ```
     PORT=3000
     DB_HOST=localhost
     DB_USER=your-username
     DB_PASS=your-password
     DB_NAME=your-database-name
     JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
     ```

   - Make sure to replace `your-database` and `your-secret-key` with your actual database name and a secure secret key for JWT.

2. **Database Setup:**

   - Ensure your MySQL server is running and create a database that matches the `DATABASE_URL` specified in your `.env` file.

   - If necessary, run migrations or seeders to set up your database schema.

## Running the Project

Once you have configured everything, you can start the project by running:

```bash
npm start
